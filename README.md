# Computer-Graphics-Project

background of the project.

A Java program for defining and rendering 3D objects, while taking into consideration their abstract properties and light origins.
The project in an introduction to software engineering at the Academic Institute, the first parts was with clear
instructions from the lecturer and the latest parts give more free hand for students, at all stages of the project.
 
The program requires problem domain: color, geometry, algebra, photography, architecture, etc. 
The program contains vectors and points created by the programmer rather than modules reserved in the work environment.
